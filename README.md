The application follows a clean, layered architecture pattern:

```
BlogApp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controllers/         # Request handling and business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/              # View models and data transfer objects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/               # Razor views for UI rendering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Entity/              # Domain models and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data/                # Data access layer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Abstract/        # Repository interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Concrete/        # Repository implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/            # Business services and utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Helpers/             # Helper classes and extensions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Middleware/          # Custom middleware components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wwwroot/             # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tests/               # Unit and integration tests
```

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling between components
- **MVC Architecture** - Separation of concerns

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) or later
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) / [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control

   ```

3. **Create and update the database:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   # or
   dotnet watch run  # For hot reload during development
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
